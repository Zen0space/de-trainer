# DE-Trainer Authentication System Implementation

## üìã Project Overview
Building a role-based authentication system for a trainer-athlete fitness tracking app using:
- **Frontend**: Expo SDK 53 + React Native + TypeScript + NativeWind
- **Backend**: Turso SQLite database 
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role-based access control

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema (Existing)
- ‚úÖ `users` - Base user authentication (id, email, password, full_name, role, created_at, is_verified)
- ‚úÖ `trainers` - Trainer-specific data (user_id, trainer_code, certification_id, specialization, verification_status)
- ‚úÖ `athletes` - Athlete-specific data (user_id, sport, level)
- ‚úÖ `enrollments` - Trainer-athlete relationships (athlete_id, trainer_id, status)
- ‚úÖ `tests`, `test_results`, `fitness_components` - Fitness tracking system
